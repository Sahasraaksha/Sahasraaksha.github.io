    "text": "Our Solution can recognize vehicle license plates using general surveillance cameras. Automatic number-plate recognition is a technology that uses optical character recognition on images to read vehicle registration plates to create vehicle location data. Our Solution performs ANPR on all the observed vehicles that enter the tracked zones. ANPR captures image of the number plates from vehicles moving at high speeds and in stop-n-go scenarios & then decodes it into alpha-numeric values."
