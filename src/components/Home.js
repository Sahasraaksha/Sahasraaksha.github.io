                Sahasraaksha is the way through which we are linking the three steps of CCTV based security (physical security, surveillance, and video backups) and adding a new, and what we assume to be the future crucial part of surveillance, analytics.

            <h1>AI in CCTV surveillance</h1>
            <p>
                Even though surveillance cameras are now ubiquitous they are rarely made use of. There has to always be at least one person surveilling the live feeds 24/7 to stop any untoward incident from happening.

                Hence, we propose an advanced AI-based solution making use of state-of-the-art deep learning approaches to provide various features that help in better understanding and managing the information one receives from the surveillance feeds, thus, leading to a qualitatively enhancement in security
