                It is impossible for 24/7 human monitoring of all cameras,
                moreover, not all cameras feeds are important since only a few
                cameras might contain objects of interest with there being a
                possibility of an anomalous event happening.

                Hence in our solution. the user can choose to view only 4 out of
                the 30 cameras which are displayed in the priority screen based
                on the importance of the events and objects detected in the
                various cameras.

                The priority order changes dynamically based on the latest
                importance value and thus the user shall see the 4 critical
                cameras alone properly at any given time.

                Though, face recognition is one of the solutions, however,
                surveillance cameras are not designed for face recognition. It
                is less probable that the exact person’s face will be captured
                with high resolution and might lead to high error rates.

                In this method, we collect all the persons spotted and create
                database out of that. In case of wanting to find a person, if
                the description of the person is known (such as clothing
                articles and gender), then the exact person can be searched for
                and retrieved.

                Since its very tiring for security personnel to keep track of
